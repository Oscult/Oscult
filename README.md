Hello, and welcome to my Github page! I'm pretty new to this, so anything you see here may be incomplete or incorrect but I'll eventually get it right. 
I've decided that since I'm working on my first dll for networking code, I should have a place to put it for backup and potential public consumption.

I'm currently in the process of teaching myself C#, .NET Core, and general network programming, and hope to eventually have a nice repository that will be of some use to someone. 
For now though this will mainly serve as a private repo, but anything fun or worth sharing will probably go here too.
